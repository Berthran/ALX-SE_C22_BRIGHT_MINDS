# ALX-SE_C22_BRIGHT_MINDS
Welcome to this repository. We have here the documentation of several learners in the ALX-SE Cohort 22.
The repository is divided into two 
- Learnings
- Code Fixes

Learnings capture what learners learn while completing projects.
Code Fixes capture the problems/bugs in codes that the learners encountered and how they resolved them.

This repository is designed to help navigate future learners in the ALX-SE program to learn from a pool of experiences.
Happy exploring
